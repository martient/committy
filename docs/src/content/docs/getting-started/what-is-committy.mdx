Committy is a command-line tool designed to help developers create standardized and well-structured Git commit messages.
Think of it as your friendly commit message assistant that follows conventional commit message formats and semantic versioning (SemVer) principles.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

The main purpose of Committy is to solve three common challenges in software development:

1. **Standardization** ✨: It ensures all commit messages follow a consistent format across a project or team by providing a structured way to create commits.

2. **Quality** ⭐: It guides developers through the process of writing informative commit messages by prompting for all necessary components: type of change, scope, description, and whether it's a breaking change.

3. **Efficiency** ⚡: It reduces the time spent thinking about commit message structure and formatting, allowing developers to focus on describing their changes.
