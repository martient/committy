Committy is shipped as a single executable file, which you can download from the [releases page](https://github.com/martient/committy/releases), but you can install it using different methods.

## Installing

### Linux and macOS

#### Curl

<Code code="curl -fsSL https://committy.martient.com/install | bash" lang="bash" title="CURL" />

#### Direct download

latest release: https://github.com/martient/committy/releases/latest

Find the asset for your platform and download it, then extract it to a directory of your choice. We recommend using `$HOME/.committy` as the install directory.

Do not forget to add the directory to your `$PATH` and save it in your `$HOME/.bashrc` or `$HOME/.zshrc`:

<Code code='export PATH="$HOME/.committy/bin:\$PATH"' lang="bash" title="PATH" />

## Check your installation

Reload your current shell to ensure the committy binary is in your `$PATH`:

<Code code="exec \$SHELL" lang="bash" title="Reload shell" />

then run:

<Code code="committy --version" lang="bash" title="Run committy" />

You should see the current version of committy !
