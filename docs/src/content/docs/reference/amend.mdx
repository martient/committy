title: Commit Amend
description: How to amend a commit
---

## Overview

Interactively amend the previous commit using conventional commit prompts. This command is interactive-only.
Amends the previous commit message and optionally content.

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive prompts for type, breaking-change, scope, short and long messages
committy amend
```

## Behavior

- __Interactive only__: running with `--non-interactive` returns an error.
- Prompts for: type, breaking change, scope, short message, and long message.
- Formats final message as `<type>(<scope>)!: <short>\n\n<long>` as applicable, then amends the last commit.
- __No staged changes required__: you can amend just the message. If there are staged changes, they will be included.
- Uses the current index (if any) for the amended commit tree.
- For non-interactive amend, use `committy commit --amend` with flags; note that path __requires staged changes__.

## Exit codes

- __0__: success
- __1__: generic error (e.g., non-interactive usage, git errors)

## Notes

- Use regular `committy commit` for new commits. Use `--amend` when you only want to adjust the previous commit message/content.
